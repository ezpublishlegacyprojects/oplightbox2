Known issues
============
1. Configuration site.ini[DesignSettings].SiteDesign and AdditionalSiteDesignList[].
The file site.ini.append.php should be configured as bellow:

[DesignSettings]
SiteDesign=ezflow
AdditionalSiteDesignList[]
AdditionalSiteDesignList[]=ezwebin
AdditionalSiteDesignList[]=base
AdditionalSiteDesignList[]=standard

Otherwise you can change the name of the design directory in oplightbox2/design/ezflow to the one you use.

2. Close button and loading image are written in hard code in file:
extension/oplightbox2/design/ezflow/javascript/lightbox/lightbox.js
